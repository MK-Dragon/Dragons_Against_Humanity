# Dragons_Against_Humanity
A fun D&amp;D take on the popular game "cards against humanity"! Draw some cards and create THE Most Fun and Chaotic story you can! (Best Played with FUN Drunk and Frieds)

<br>

## How to Play:

The Gameplay Loop:

1) The **Dungeon Master** (DM) for the Round: One player starts as the DM. They draw a **Quest Card** (the prompt card with blanks).

2) The **Party’s** Response: Every other player looks at their hand of **Loot Cards** (classes, items, spells, NPCs) and submits the funniest or most chaotic card(s) face down.

3) The Reveal: The DM reads the Quest Card aloud, filling in the blanks with the submitted cards.

4) The Reward: The DM chooses the winner based on what made them laugh the most. The winner receives an **Inspiration Point** (the card they won).

5) Passing the Torch: The role of DM rotates clockwise for the next round.

6) **Victory**: The first player to reach a set number of **Inspiration Points** (e.g., 5 or 10) is declared the ***"Legendary Hero."***
